## Dotfiles
* My dotfiles feel like 127.0.0.1 to me ❤️
* Just a bunch of files that make me happy & optimize/improve the QOL/speed for the development cycle :)
* These dotfiles aim to allow me to work as fast as I can think. These are likely highly opinionated.

## Installing
* You probably don't want to blindly install other peoples dotfiles. But if you're sure you do:
* `bash mk-symlinks.sh` from this projects root directory to install everything
* `bash mk-symlinks.sh` from any subdirectory to install the configs present in that subdirectory alone
* Basically this just makes symbolic links to the appropriate directories.
* The 'install' will fail silently if you already have these directories present, delete them manually for reasons.
